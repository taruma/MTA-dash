This interactive dashboard, "**MTA Ridership Explorer**," provides a view 
into ridership trends for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), 
New York's public transportation network. It allows users to explore daily 
ridership data across various MTA services, including **🚆 subways, 🚌 buses, commuter rails 
(🚄 LIRR and 🚉 Metro-North), paratransit (🚐 Access-A-Ride), 🌉 bridges and tunnels, 
and the 🚋 Staten Island Railway**. The dashboard aims to highlight ridership patterns since 
the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, offering a glimpse into recovery trends and 
the current state of public transit usage. Users can switch between daily, 
weekly, monthly, and yearly views to examine the data, and compare both 
absolute ridership numbers and the percentage recovered compared 
to pre-pandemic levels.
