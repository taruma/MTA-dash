Overview Project

**Project Overview: Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) Ridership Dashboard**

**Data Description:**
- The dataset includes daily estimates of ridership and traffic for various MTA services, starting from March 1, 2020. It provides a percentage comparison against pre-pandemic ridership for the following services: 
  - Subways
  - Buses
  - Long Island Rail Road (LIRR)
  - Metro-North Railroad (MNR)
  - Access-A-Ride (AAR) Paratransit Service
  - Bridges and Tunnels (B&T)
  - Staten Island Railway (SIR)

- The dataset fields include both absolute numbers and percentage comparisons with pre-pandemic days, enabling analysis of recovery patterns.

**Key Metrics:**
1. **Total Estimated Ridership/Traffic:**
   - Absolute values indicating the number of passengers or vehicles for each mode of transport on a daily basis.

2. **Percentage of Comparable Pre-Pandemic Day:**
   - A percentage comparing current ridership/traffic against the typical ridership of the same day type (weekday, Saturday, Sunday/holiday) in 2019.

**Contextual Background:**
- The MTA is responsible for much of the public transportation in New York, serving New York City and surrounding regions. It includes both commuter railroads and local transit services.
- Understanding trends in MTA ridership helps stakeholders assess the impact of COVID-19 and plan for future transit needs.

**Analytical Objectives:**
- Analyze how ridership levels fluctuate over time, particularly in relation to major public policy shifts or societal events (e.g., lockdowns, reopening phases).
- Compare the recovery rates across different transportation modes to identify which services have rebounded most effectively.
- Investigate seasonal trends and day-of-week variations in ridership as part of the recovery analysis.
- Provide actionable insights for transport authorities to enhance service delivery and cater to changing commuter patterns.

**User Engagement:**
- The dashboard will feature interactive visualizations, enabling users to explore data by selecting specific date ranges, transportation modes, and targeted insights.
- The integration of an LLM will provide users with narrative descriptions of the data, making it accessible to both data-savvy users and the general public.

**End Goal:**
- To effectively communicate the recovery trends of MTA services post-pandemic, offering valuable insights for decision-makers, while also demonstrating the power of data visualization and natural language processing in understanding complex datasets.
