The graph presents a comprehensive overview of the ridership trends for the **Long Island Rail Road (LIRR)** and **Metro-North Railroad (MNR)** from March 2020 to October 2024. The data reveals significant fluctuations in ridership levels, reflecting the broader impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent recovery phases. Initially, both services experienced a dramatic decline in ridership, with numbers plummeting close to zero in early 2020. This aligns with the onset of the pandemic and the resulting lockdown measures.

Over time, a gradual recovery is observed. For **LIRR**, the ridership steadily increased, with peaks reaching approximately 1.7 million by mid-2024. **MNR** showed a similar pattern, although with slightly lower peaks, reaching around 1.45 million. Despite these improvements, the recovery trajectory for both services has not been linear, with periodic declines corresponding to various external factors, such as policy changes or seasonal variations.

The percentage drop from pre-pandemic levels indicates that both services faced substantial challenges in returning to 2019 ridership figures. **LIRR** demonstrated a more robust recovery, with some weeks surpassing pre-pandemic levels, achieving a maximum recovery rate of over 112%. In contrast, **MNR** lagged slightly, with a maximum recovery rate of nearly 98%. This suggests that **LIRR** may have been more resilient or quicker to adapt to changing commuter needs.

Statistical analysis further supports these observations, showing that the mean ridership for **LIRR** was approximately 946,726, while **MNR** averaged around 799,998 during the analyzed period. The standard deviation values indicate that **LIRR** experienced slightly more variability in recovery compared to **MNR**. These metrics highlight the differences in how each service responded to fluctuating demand and external conditions.

The recovery trends suggest that both railroads have made significant strides toward pre-pandemic levels, although the journey has been uneven. **LIRR** appears to have achieved a more consistent and higher rate of recovery, potentially due to factors such as service frequency adjustments or shifts in commuter behavior. **MNR**, while also recovering, has not consistently surpassed pre-pandemic ridership, indicating potential areas for further optimization.

In conclusion, the recovery trends for both **Long Island Rail Road** and **Metro-North Railroad** reflect a positive trajectory towards pre-pandemic ridership levels. **_While challenges remain, particularly for MNR, the overall trend is upward, signaling resilience and adaptability within the MTA network._** These insights can guide future strategies for enhancing service delivery and meeting evolving commuter needs.
