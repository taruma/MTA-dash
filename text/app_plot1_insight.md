This graph provides a visual analysis of the ridership trends for the **Long Island Rail Road (LIRR)** and **Metro-North Railroad (MNR)** from March 2020 to October 2024. The solid lines represent the estimated ridership volumes, while the dotted lines indicate the percentage drop from pre-pandemic levels, where lower percentage values signify stronger recovery.

Initially, both **LIRR** and **MNR** experienced a sharp decline in ridership around March 2020, coinciding with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, over time, a gradual recovery is observed, with fluctuations likely corresponding to various public policy shifts and societal events such as lockdowns and reopening phases. By mid-2022, ridership for both services began to stabilize, although not yet reaching pre-pandemic levels by this time.

As we move into 2023 and beyond, both services show a consistent upward trend in ridership volumes. Notably, the dotted lines for percentage drop indicate significant recovery, with some periods approaching or even exceeding pre-pandemic ridership levels (indicated by negative percentage values). This suggests a robust recovery trajectory, especially evident in the latter part of 2023 and into 2024.

In conclusion, the graph highlights a positive recovery trend for both **LIRR** and **MNR**. Despite initial setbacks, these services are progressively reaching and surpassing their pre-pandemic ridership figures, reflecting an adaptation to new commuting patterns and possibly increased reliance on these transit options. This insight is crucial for transportation authorities to optimize service delivery and address evolving commuter needs.
