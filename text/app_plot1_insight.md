The graph provides a detailed visualization of ridership recovery trends for the **Long Island Rail Road (LIRR)** and **Metro-North Railroad (MNR)** from March 2020 to October 2024. Initially, both services experienced a significant drop in ridership due to the pandemic. The **LIRR** and **MNR** saw sharp declines, with their ridership dropping to almost zero in early 2020. This reflects the immediate impact of COVID-19 lockdowns and restrictions.

Over time, both rail services show a gradual recovery. **LIRR** ridership started to increase steadily from mid-2020, with a noticeable uptick in early 2021. This pattern suggests that as restrictions eased and vaccination efforts ramped up, more commuters returned to using the rail service. By 2023, **LIRR** ridership approaches pre-pandemic levels, even surpassing them at certain points, as indicated by the line crossing the 100% mark on the right axis.

Similarly, **Metro-North Railroad** ridership mirrors this recovery trend but with some differences in pace and timing. The recovery for **MNR** appears slightly more volatile, with fluctuations indicating varied commuter confidence and possible impacts of external factors like remote work policies. Despite these variations, **MNR** also shows strong recovery, reaching around 80-90% of pre-pandemic levels by late 2023 and early 2024.

The graph indicates that **LIRR** appears to have a slightly faster recovery rate compared to **MNR**, likely due to differences in commuter demographics and travel patterns. **_This is a critical update_** for transport authorities as it highlights the resilience of both rail services and underscores the importance of adapting to changing commuter needs. These insights are valuable for planning future service delivery and infrastructure investments to support sustained ridership growth.
